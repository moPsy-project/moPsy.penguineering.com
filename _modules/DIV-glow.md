The <b>moPsy DIV Glow</b> is a rhythm and clock divider with six output stages, similar to the Doepfer A-160-1.

It is the <i>Dark-Mode</i>-version of <a href="{% link _modules/DIV.md %}">moPsy DIV</a>, with the same functions, but a dark panel and illuminated jacks instead of separate LEDs.

<b>This module is available in limited quantities only!</b>

It accepts <b>audio frequencies</b> and happily scales them down by several octaves.
(Bear in mind that the output will be 50% PWM.)

The reset input can be configured to trigger from the bus gate with a jumper.
